Blazor .net 8 web application that demonstrates that InteractiveMode.Auto does not work as described. The expected behavior is that initial load is server interactive and that wasm downloads in the background and the component will only run in wasm the next time the component is accessed. What actually happens is that as soon as wasm downloads the server interactive component is wiped and replaced with the wasm component. All state is lost in the transition.
